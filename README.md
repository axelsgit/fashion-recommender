# fashion-recommender
This project builds a hybrid and visual recommender system for (luxury) fashion products, simulating a real-world e-commerce scenario (e.g., Zalando, Farfetch, Fashion Nova). It integrates visual filtering, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models, enriched with user metadata and interaction recency.
